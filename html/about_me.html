      My name is Jonathan James Franco. I am a hard working, open minded,
      and enthusiastic engineer. I am a graduate from California Baptist
      University, majoring in Software Engineering, and earning a 3.67 GPA
      within my time there from 2018 to 2023. I enjoy learning about new technology
      that is out in the world, previous technology that helped pave the way for the
      technology of today, and the future technology of tomorrow that will help to make
      the world a more harmonious place for the future generation to live in. I am a 
      team player and love to explore new types of environments both in the physical 
      world and in the world of technology and coding. I like to learn new programming 
      languages as well as get to learn more about current programming languages I'm 
      already familiar with and progrmaming languages I use daily. I am a fast learner when it 
      comes to learning a new programming language or a different type of coding 
      environment or IDE whether on the job or in my personal time. I believe that 
      we never stop learning something new every day and that we should always be 
      open to change that will help to make people be inspired to create a better world
      for the next generations to come. I love getting to work with others because
      it helps me to become inspired to be a better engineer and coder and explore
      new, efficient, and better ways to code more clean and organized and to help
      make projects run faster and better. I like to be open minded with others
      and establish a great relationship with people and maintain communication as I 
      believe that it's important to hear other people's opinions about how to approach
      a project or feature no matter how big or small in order to understand how your
      fellow coworkers think and understand their point of view in coding and become
      inspired to learn a new form of coding through this form of learning. I believe
      communication is very important, especially when it comes to asking for help on 
      something you're not sure on how to approach a task or project. Asking for help is 
      a sign that shows that you're wanting to get things done correctly and make sure 
      the project is working before it gets deployed for the world to see. I always like 
      to make sure a project or assignment is done right before getting it sent into 
      production and I will always ask for help when I need it. I can't wait to get connected
      with you soon!
