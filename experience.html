      From September 2018 to October 2018, I was part of a team that presented a Nao robot 
      as a part of a project for our EGR101 class to represent California Baptist University 
      over at the STEP  conference at the Bourns Center in Riverside, California when 
      presenting to other public elementary and middle schools. I also volunteered as a night 
      tour guide when the STEP Conference was being held at night for the general public. 
      I learned and obtained social skills, directional skills, and improved my presentation 
      skills when amongst different audience and age groups. I also came to help at the Bourns 
      Center again in 2019 where I helped to put California Baptist University's booth 
      and station up and helped to take it down again.

      From May 17, 2022 to August 30, 2022, I became a web development intern for Saddleback Church 
      in which I programmed and coded two different projects for Saddleback Church's main website 
      which consist of the <a href="https://saddleback.com/visit/about/beliefs-and-values" target="_blank">
      Beliefs and Values</a> webpage, which is a webpage that replaced their former About Us webpage and
      the <a href="https://saddleback.com/connect/ministry/the-daniel-plan" target="_blank">The 
      Daniel Plan</a> webpage, which is an updated version of their previous webpage. These different
      projects were originally designed in Figma and with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and some of 
      its other libraries to create two dynamic webpages that are still currently up on their 
      website today. During my time as a web development inter, I also engaged in QA sessions, 
      intern training, and special Scrum meetings where the web developer interns learned the 
      essentials about Scrum meetings and what it's meant to do and achieve every day.

      From September 27, 2023 to November 2, 2024, I worked as a Tech Consultant for Target at The 
      Crossings in Corona, California pushing products onto the floor for the Tech/Electronic, 
      Entertainment, Adult and Kid Books, and Luggage departments while keeping up with technology 
      specifications, facts, and knowledge to be able to provide answers for guests who needed help
      with specific questions when it comes to technology ranging from phones and its accessories 
      like charging cables, cases, and earbuds, and streaming devices like Amazon Fire Sticks, Roku's,
      and Apple TV's to laptops and video game consoles and its accessories like games, controllers, 
      headphones, and gaming setups. I not only provided customer service for the guests, but I also 
      pulled and pushed tech priorities for the next work day, set new price tag changes for any revisions
      needed for the week as well as update displays when new products need to be showcased and released
      to the public. I also helped manage the Tech, Entertainment, Adult and Kid Books, and Luggage 
      departments and zone the areas to make sure the areas were taken care of and organized to help
      make the aisles more organized and easy for guests to find items, helped my coworkers who
      work in the Order Pick Up departments to find items needed for any curbside and driveup pickup 
      order, and helped maintain a special relationship between me in Target Tech and MarketSource's mobile
      team who are there to help activate guests' phones to be able to help them help guests when it
      comes to understanding their iPhone and Android phones and accessories.
