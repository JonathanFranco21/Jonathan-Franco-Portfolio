      In 2018, I was part of a team that presented a Nao robot as a part of a project
      for our EGR101 class to represent California Baptist University over at the STEP 
      conference at the Bourns Center in Riverside, California when presenting to other 
      public elementary and middle schools. I also volunteered as a night tour guide when 
      the STEP Conference was being held at night for the general public. I learned and 
      obtained social skills, directional skills, and improved my presentation skills 
      when amongst different audience and age groups. I also came to help at the Bourns 
      Center again in 2019 where I helped to put California Baptist University's booth 
      and station up and helped to take it down again.

      In 2022, I became a web development intern for Saddleback Church in which I programmed
      and coded two different projects for Saddleback Church's main website which consist of 
      the <a href="https://saddleback.com/visit/about/beliefs-and-values" target="_blank">Beliefs
      and Values</a> webpage, which is a webpage that replaced their former About Us webpage and
      the <a href="https://saddleback.com/connect/ministry/the-daniel-plan" target="_blank">The 
      Daniel Plan</a> webpage, which is an updated version of their previous webpage. These different
      projects were originally designed in Figma and with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and some of 
      its other libraries to create two dynamic webpages that are still currently up on their 
      website today. During my time as a web development inter, I also engaged in QA sessions, 
      intern training, and special Scrum meetings where the web developer interns learned the essentials
      about Scrum meetings and what it's meant to do and achieve every day.
